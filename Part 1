# Log transform to long tailed distributions
# Polynomial transforms to non-linear distributions
# Calculated Fields
# Binning of variables - clustering
# Correlations between variables - remove a variable/column
# Add interactions for 2 variables
# Calculate variable significance
# - univariate relationship with dependent variable
# - correlation with dependent variable (discernable pattern?)
# - p value

# standardized variables with standardized coefficients
# change in Rsquared when variable is included/excluded
